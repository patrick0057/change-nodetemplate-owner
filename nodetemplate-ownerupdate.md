# Rancher nodetemplate owner change
This guide will show you how to change your nodetemplate owner for situations where the original user is no longer with the company.  This guide will only work if the original user has not already been deleted.  If the original user has been deleted it is possible that your nodetemplate may already be deleted.
1. In the Rancher user interface, select your cluster then grab the cluster ID from your address bar.  I have listed an example of the URL and cluster ID below.
..*Example URL: https://<RANCHER URL>/c/c-48x9z/monitoring
..*Derrived cluster ID from above URL: c-48x9z
